This program is for training a language model using various tokenization techniques and the GPT-2 model.

Tokenization with Pre-trained Models:
-> It uses BertTokenizer to tokenize a sentence using a pre-trained BERT model.
-> It demonstrates how to use SentencePieceBPETokenizer and ByteLevelBPETokenizer to tokenize sentences by training these tokenizers on a provided text file.

Custom Tokenizer Training:
-> It trains custom tokenizers using SentencePiece BPE and Byte-Level BPE techniques on text data from files.
-> The tokenizers are trained using either a single pass through the files or by iterating through the files, which is useful when the dataset is too large to fit into memory.

Language Model Training:
-> A custom vocabulary is created by training a Byte-Level BPE tokenizer on the text files.
-> A GPT-2 model is initialized and fine-tuned on the tokenized data.
-> The script prepares a dataset by tokenizing input text files and then trains the GPT-2 model using this dataset.
-> Finally, it saves the trained language model.

Expected Output:
-> Tokenized sentences using BERT and custom-trained tokenizers.
-> A fine-tuned GPT-2 language model saved to the specified directory.
-> A message indicating the completion of the training process.
